Lemonade Catcher is a project I wrote for KPMG's Software Dev. Intern Summer 2026 application! Its purpose is to demonstrate my proficiency in Node.JS, MySQL, HTML/CSS, & Javascript :)

To streamline this process, streamlit or Flask with Python could be used -- potential future coding project for me.
